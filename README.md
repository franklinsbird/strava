# Strava Data Analytics

I'm running the San Francisco Marathon in July 2025 and want to easily track my training data from Strava. I've created a marathon training plan and want to pull my raw Strava activity from the Strava API into Google Sheets so that I can track my progress against my goals. I have 4 main goals:

# 1) Run 1k miles this year

# 2) Increase my weekly mileage to 50 miles / week

# 3) Do one long run per week. Increase distance from 15 to 20 miles as the race approaches

# 4) Track the distribution of my run lengths and vary the distances
